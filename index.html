    <title> Spaceflight data by Country</title>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="header_card">
        <h1> Spaceflight Data by Country </h1>
        <p class="dashboard-subtitle">An interactive dashboard exploring global spaceflight activity: total launches, people sent to space, launch cost trends, and NASA's annual budget. The data in this dashboard is dominated
            by the United States, and then the Soviet Union, which is now Russia. Most of the trends can be related to the space race and the cold war in the 1950s and 1960s between the two countries.

    <h2>Total Space Launches by Country</h2>
    
    <div id="chart_container">
        <div class="chart-description">
        <p>Choropleth map of total space launches by country. Countries with higher launch counts are highlighted with a darker color
            The data starts from as far back as 1957, when the first satellite was launched by the Soviet Union. From this map, we can see 
            that the Soviet Union and the United States have been the most active countries in space exploration, with China being the next
            closest competitor.

    <h3>Number of People Who Have Been To Space per Country</h3>
    <div id="container2">
        <div class="chart-description">
        <p>This bar chart tracks human spaceflight participation since Yuri Gagarin's historic 1961 flight. The data reveals a dramatic disparity: the United States has sent 347 people to space (nearly 3x more than any other nation), while Russia follows with 124 astronauts. China ranks third with just 11 people, reflecting its later entry into human spaceflight. The data underscores the immense cost and complexity of human space programs, limiting participation to only the most resource-rich nations.</p>

    <h4> Cost of launching to space (per rocket class)</h4>
    <div id="container3">
        <div id = "bubble_chart"></div>
        <div class="chart-description">
        <p>This scatter plot reveals the dramatic evolution of launch costs over six decades, showing how technological advancement and market competition have driven prices down. The data spans from 1963 to 2018, with costs ranging from $1,500 to $177,900 per kilogram. 
            Heavy payload vehicles (red) generally offer the best cost efficiency, while small payloads (blue) are most expensive per kilogram due to fixed costs. 
            Notable trends include SpaceX's Falcon 9 (2010s) achieving costs under $5,000/kg, compared to early 1960s vehicles costing over $100,000/kg. This visualization demonstrates how launch costs have decreased by over 90% since the space race era, 
            enabling the current commercial space boom and making space more accessible to smaller nations and private companies.</p>

    <h2>NASA Annual Budget</h2>
    <div id="container4">
        <div id="nasa_budget"></div>
        <div class="chart-description">
        <p>This line chart tracks NASA's budget from 1959-2021, revealing the dramatic funding patterns that shaped the space age. The peak in 1966 represents the height of the Apollo program, when NASA received 4.4% of the entire federal budget. The marked decline after 1969 reflects the end of the space race, with budgets stabilizing around $20-25 billion annually. 
            The highlighted 1966 point shows the Cold War peak when the US committed unprecedented resources to beat the Soviets to the Moon. The data shows that despite budget fluctuations, NASA has maintained significant funding levels, enabling continued space exploration and scientific advancement even after the Apollo program ended.</p>
