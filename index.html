    <title> Spaceflight data by Country</title>

        <h1> Spaceflight Data by Country </h1>
        <p class="dashboard-subtitle">An interactive dashboard exploring global spaceflight activity: total launches, people sent to space, launch cost trends, and NASA's annual budget.
        </p>

    <h2>Total Space Launches by Country</h2>
    
    <div id="chart_container">
        <div class="chart-description">
        <p>Proportional symbol map of total space launches by country. Larger circles indicate more launches, <br> positioned at each country's centroid.
            The United States, Russia, and China dominate in total launches.</p>

    <h3>Number of People Who Have Been To Space per Country</h3>
    <div id="container2">
        <div class="chart-description">
        <p>This bar chart tracks human spaceflight participation since Yuri Gagarin's historic 1961 <br> flight. The data reveals a dramatic disparity: the United States has sent <br> 347 people to space (nearly 3x more than any other nation), <br> while Russia follows with 124 astronauts. China ranks third with just 11 people, reflecting its later entry into human spaceflight. The data underscores the immense cost and complexity of human space programs, limiting participation to only the most resource-rich nations.</p>

    <h4> Cost of launching to space (per rocket class)</h4>
    <div id="container3">
        <div id = "bubble_chart"></div>
        <div class="chart-description">
        <p>This scatter plot reveals the dramatic evolution of launch costs over six decades, showing how technological advancement and market competition have driven prices down. The data spans from 1963 to 2018, with costs ranging from $1,500 to $177,900 per kilogram. 
            Heavy payload vehicles (red) generally offer the best cost efficiency, while small payloads (blue) are most expensive per kilogram due to fixed costs. 
            Notable trends include SpaceX's Falcon 9 (2010s) achieving costs under $5,000/kg, compared to early 1960s vehicles costing over $100,000/kg. .</p>

    <h2>NASA Annual Budget</h2>
    <div id="container4">
        <div id="nasa_budget"></div>
        <div class="chart-description">
        <p>This line chart tracks NASA's budget from 1959-2021, revealing the dramatic funding patterns that shaped the space age. The peak in 1966 represents the height of the Apollo program, when NASA received 4.4% of the entire federal budget. The marked decline after 1969 reflects the end of the space race, with budgets stabilizing around $20-25 billion annually. 
            The highlighted 1966 point shows the Cold War peak when the US committed unprecedented resources to beat the Soviets to the Moon.</p>
